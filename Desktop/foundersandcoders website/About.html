    <h1>Who am I</h1>
    <p1>I have been born and raised in Poland. My family come from central and southern Poland (Krakow and Skarzysko) which is mostly lowlands, forests, lakes and meadows.
      I’ve started high school in downtown Chicago and completed it in Skarzysko, followed by a degree in Sociology from University of Lodz.

  <p2>After graduation, I’ve worked in Media Research in London for many years, managing large international projects for Kantar Media.
    When my daughter turned 9, I decided to finally follow my dream and move into Web development. I quit my job at Kantar at the end of July to start the 7 weeks long Front End boot camp in Krakow. It starts on the 27th August. <span class "highlight">CodersLab</span> here I come !!

      <h1>Why Founders and Coders</h1>
      <p5>At the beginning of 2018, roughly at the same time that I decided to follow my dreams, I have found a couple of web development bootcamps in Poland that would help me to move into career I always wanted to pursue. At first it was meant to be a front-end followed by a back-end with PHP. Both based on working in class with the tutor. Only then I found Founders and Coders and decided to swap the back-end in Krakow for the course offered by Founders & Coders. What got me interested is the collaborative environment you're promising and the fact that I can take part in training others. I think this is a great way to learn self-motivation and self-learning rather than relying on the tutor. This is a great asset in the always changing development field. ' </p5>

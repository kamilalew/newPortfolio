                            Some of London’s most scenic and photo worthy spots are also the least well-known, even among those who have lived and loved London for their whole life.

                            The gallery above shows off these hidden heroes. Places that are tucked away off the beaten track, or hidden in plain sight right in front of your nose. The thoroughly lovely line-up includes an abandoned Victorian pumping station, a floating restaurant, a tank and an opulent cafe hidden within one of the city’s most famous museums.
